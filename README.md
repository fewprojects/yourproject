## What is 'Your Project' 

It is a simple one page HTML, CSS web template to showcase any github dev project of yours

-Typography is fluid and lucid, so that you don't have to worry about multiple screens 

- Easy & minimal webpage design

- I have tried my best to keep the code clean so that you can replace default assets with ease

- I have written comments inside the codes to help you in understanding it

- In case if I am unable to manage it, you're welcome to contribute into it.
